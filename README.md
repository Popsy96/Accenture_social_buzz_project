The Accenture Social Buzz Project seems to be a virtual experience project conducted by Accenture North. In this project, Excel was used for data cleaning, and Tableau was employed for data visualization. By combining these tools, the project likely aimed to analyze social buzz or online engagement related to Accenture's products, services, or brand across various social media platforms.

The use of Excel for data cleaning indicates that the team worked on preparing the data for analysis, ensuring it was in a suitable format and free from any errors or inconsistencies. Subsequently, Tableau was utilized to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the insights and trends related to social buzz.

Overall, this project likely helped Accenture North gain valuable insights into their online presence and audience perception, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and refine their social media strategies.
